# expressionTree

This is an attempt to create a simple scanner (tokenizer) and parser that builds a parse tree from a user specified mathematical expression.

# Compile/Build Instructions

Assume `gcc` and `Make` are available on the machine.

- refer to `Makefile` for build, test, and clean instructions.
- On successful builds, an executable named `expressionTree` will be present in the working directory.
- if `valgrind` is installed on the machine, `make valgrind` will run the executable with valgrind to check for memory errors.

## Rules Summary

### Simple Build

`make`

### Build Then Execute

`make test`

### Build, Test, Execute + Check Memory Fault

- assume ` valgrind` is installed on machine

`make valgrind`

### Remove Executable

` make clean`
