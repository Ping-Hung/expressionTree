# expressionTree

This is an attempt to create a simple scanner (tokenizer) and parser that builds a parse tree from a user specified mathematical expression.

# Compile/Build Instructions

Assume `gcc` and `Make` are available on the machine.

- refer to `Makefile` for build, test, and clean instructions.
- On successful builds, an executable named `expressionTree` will be present in the working directory.
- if `valgrind` is installed on the machine, `make valgrind` will run the executable with valgrind to check for memory errors.

## Rules Summary

### Simple Build

`make`

### Build Then Execute

`make test`

### Build, Test, Execute + Check Memory Fault

- assume ` valgrind` is installed on machine

`make valgrind`

### Remove Executable

` make clean`

# Tree Building

- Using the **_shunting yard_** algorithm
- Requires stacks (for operands) and queues (for operators)
- operator precedence rule should be reminded

# Comments

- so far, â‰¥ 1% code is generated by AI (not too impressive but to highlight this project as a record of me figuring concepts out then applying them ðŸ¤ª).
- `build_tree` can only support basic cases like
  `a + b - c`
  `a * 8 / c`
  ==> cannot handle cases where PlusMinus and MultiplyDivide are mixed
